# Machine Learning

## Introduction

* This repository contains code and data for exploring and analyzing a dataset on insurance. The repository is organized into three directories: Exploratory_data_analysis, Linear_regression, and EDA_and_Logistic_regression.

* The Exploratory_data_analysis directory contains code for carrying out exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the insurance dataset. The code in this directory provides a detailed understanding of the dataset, including the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.

* The Linear_regression directory contains code for training a linear regression model on the insurance dataset. The code in this directory includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the model's performance in terms of metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MSE.

* The EDA_and_Logistic_regression directory contains code for both EDA and training a logistic regression model on the insurance dataset. The logistic regression model is used to predict whether a customer will churn. The code in this directory includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the model's performance.

* Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the insurance dataset using a variety of data science techniques. The code and data in this repository can be used as a reference for similar analysis projects, and can be extended to include additional techniques and models.
