#  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Step by step Explanation

#### Available variables in the dataset

Age, sex, bmi, region, children, region, 
smoker: whether the individual is a smoker or not, 
charges: the cost of insurance for the individual.

### Steps

* Firstly, we check the shape of the dataset to determine the number of rows and columns it has.
* We then look for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
* Next, we check the data types of the variables to ensure that they are in the correct format.
* After that, we summarize the statistics of the numerical variables to understand their distribution and central tendency measures.
*Then, we visualize the distribution of the variables using various types of plots such as histograms, density plots, and box plots.
* We also check the relationship between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.
* Lastly, we check the distribution of the categorical variables using bar plots and pie charts.

*These steps help us gain insights into the dataset, identify any outliers or anomalies, and understand the relationships between variables. EDA is a crucial step in data analysis as it helps in making informed decisions and choosing the appropriate statistical techniques for further analysis.
