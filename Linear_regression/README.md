# Linear regression
* Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).  

## The following are the basic steps for which I implemented linear regression:


* Import the necessary modules required for the implementation of the model. In this case, we need to import the training models from the sklearn module and the math module.

* Load the data required for the model. This data can be in the form of a CSV file or any other form that is supported by the model.

* Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

* Fit the linear regression model on the training data. This involves finding the optimal values for the model parameters that minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values.

* Predict the charges on the test data using the trained model. This will give an estimate of how well the model is able to predict new data.

* Finally, evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics will help us determine how well the model is performing and whether it needs further improvement.
